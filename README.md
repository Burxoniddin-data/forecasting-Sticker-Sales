## Project Overview

The competition dataset provides an opportunity to experiment with various machine learning techniques. The task involves feature engineering, model training, and optimization to achieve the best possible prediction performance on the test set.

## Approach

In this project, we will use **LightGBM**, a gradient boosting framework that is highly efficient for large datasets and numerical features. The workflow will include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzing the distribution of features.
   - Identifying missing values and outliers.
   - Visualizing feature relationships.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Scaling and normalizing numerical features (if required).

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new features from existing ones.
   - Selecting the most relevant features using feature importance metrics.

4. **Modeling with LightGBM:**
   - Setting up a LightGBM model.
   - Tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation.
   - Evaluating the model on the validation set.

5. **Submission:**
   - Generating predictions for the test dataset.
   - Formatting and submitting the predictions to Kaggle.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `lightgbm`

You can install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn lightgbm
```
